# School_District_Analysis

Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
use python library for data manipulation and analysis. In Jupyter Notebook read raw data, clean and inspect data, merge data sets, perform calculations, and create tables. With this data inside Jupyter Notebook the data can be changed in layout and structure, organized by type, formatted rows and or columns, and sort or group data. Inside this notebook I've imported Pandas library. With Pandas I've optimized performance, it's very flexible, and these functions exceed those from Excel. Maria needs assistance analyzing data from several school districts on their performance trends for math and reading for their standardized testing proficiency. Assisting Maria with data regarding school funding and student performance on standardized tests. These performance analyses will be sent to the school board to determine funding the budget allotments.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
I find there are no differences on the district level from the original PyCitySchools analysis to the Challenge analysis with the Thomas High School 9th grade NaN errors removed from the math and reading grades. 

see School_District_analysis_prior_NaN and School_District_analysis_with_NaN . 
See minimal differences on the Charter level. The original values are 83.474 average math and 83.896 average reading and these are updated to 83.465 average math and 83.902 average reading scores. 

How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type
Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
